## Chapter 52
Oh yeah, Jimmy
<br> The sign on the dirt road into the compound said "Cranston County Population Four" in unassuming black letters hand-painted on old pine. I was passing through the area on my way east, and while I was there, Sam asked me to meet up with an old buddy of hers, Peter. Peter didn't give out his last name to strangers, I was going to have to earn it if I wanted to include it in my write-up.  Peter was teaching a hand-raised caribou how to paint with its mouth, after unsucessfully trying to get it to use its hooves. 
<br>I hadn't been this close to the Canadian border in a few months, and longer than that since I had been in the Idaho panhandle. A few years before, Johnny and I had hit a rough patch and fell in with some hardcore libertarians who were living in a commune to stick it to the commies, whatever that meant. We were in that hole for three months repairing tractors from the 50s and processing goats.  When the leader got arrested for sending fake spiritual consulting invoices to tech companies we made the decision to leave before the power-vacuum got nasty, I never found out what happened to the group.
<br>Anyway, back to Peter.
