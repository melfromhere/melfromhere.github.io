Did I ever tell you about the time I found Henry Kissinger's shapewear in an abandoned storage unit inside the national radio quiet zone? What a trip, let me tell you. We were somewhere near the Virginia State line in the Blue Ridge mountains, close enough to see decommissioned radio telescopes. 
I was in the area and decided to look up my old buddy Remir. Remir's parents were soviet expats who didn't appreciate the westernization of Russia after the Iron Curtain came down, which never really explained why they ended up in rural Virginia, but who's counting really. Remir and I met on an icebreaker in the North Pacific. We spent most of our time rescuing rich kids who needed to learn a lesson before they could join their parents in whatever c-suite they were destined for. But I'm getting distracted. Remir's parents had left him a storage facility that hadn't been touched in years after a hillariously corrupt lawyer lost the probate documents during her arrest for forging baseball cards.
